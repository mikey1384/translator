# Electron Application Setup Progress

## What We've Completed

1. **Project Initialization**

   - Set up a TypeScript-based Electron project structure
   - Configured Bun as the package manager and build tool
   - Created tsconfig.json for TypeScript configuration
   - Added necessary dependencies in package.json

2. **Project Structure**

   - Created main process, renderer, and preload script directories
   - Set up IPC communication structure between renderer and main process
   - Created service-based architecture for FFmpeg, File Management, etc.

3. **Core Services**

   - Implemented FileManager for file operations
   - Created a stub AIService for API integrations
   - Implemented IPC handlers for communication between processes

4. **Testing Setup**

   - Configured Jest for testing
   - Created test mocks for Electron APIs
   - Set up basic unit tests

5. **Documentation**
   - Created README.md for project overview
   - Created migration guide explaining architecture and implementation
   - Added GitHub setup instructions
   - Set up CI/CD workflow with GitHub Actions

## What's Left To Do
